Got a hometown crowd yellin' out loud
On a Friday night football game
Sunday after church we all go down to the local cafe
It's like my blue jeans, my dirty old boots
Like my Chevrolet, and my red white and blue
Yeah you know it's the truth

'Cause it's a simple town and that's how we like it
Love Jesus and Jones and we ain't gonna stop it
Just an old town square, county fair
And a creek where the boys try to get a little lucky
But it's part of me, and part of you
It'll be a part of our kids too
You can bet when I get back I ain't gonna leave
This simple town

Growin' up all anybody dreamed about was gettin' out
'Til we got out in the real world man we saw what it was all about
Out there it's back stabbin' but I'm back-trackin' back to my hometown
It's where my heart is, I'll fall apart if I don't get back now

'Cause it's a simple town and that's how we like it
Love Jesus and Jones and we ain't gonna stop it
Just an old town square, county fair
And a creek where the boys try to get a little lucky
But it's part of me, and part of you
It'll be a part of our kids too
And you can bet when I get back I ain't gonna leave
This simple town

It's a Small Town, U.S.A., a little work and play
A little everybody knows everybody, and we like it that way

Yeah it's a simple town and that's how we like it
Love Jesus and Jones and we ain't gonna stop it
Just an old town square, county fair
And a creek where the boys try to get a little lucky
But it's part of me, and part of you
It'll be a part of our kids too
And you can bet your sweet ass I ain't gonna leave
Yeah this is right where I'm supposed to be
In this simple town
I love this simple town yeah, yeah, yeah
