We're gonna do a song for you right now
That was a title song off of an album
That we did some time ago
And when that song first came out
I got some flack for doing this tune
I got called some names
I dont' care

I ain't nothin' but a simple man
They call me a redneck, I reckon that I am
But there's things going on
Make me mad down to the core

I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
And there's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder'n hell
And I ain't gon' take it no more

We tell our kids to just say, "No"
Then some pantywaist judge lets a drug dealer go
Slaps him on the wrist
And turns him back out on the town

If I had my way with people sellin' dope
I'd take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing
'Til the sun goes down

And you know what's wrong with the world today?
People done gone put their Bibles away
And they're living by the law of the jungle
Not the law of the land
And the Good Book says it, so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you goin'
Remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

I'm the kinda man wouldn't harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin' in my house
Got twelve gauge shotgun a-waitin' on the other side

So don't go pushing me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you, but I darn sure will
You don't want trouble
Then you'd better just pass me on by

As far as I'm concerned, there ain't no excuse
For the raping and the killing and the child abuse
And I've got a way to put an end to all of that mess

You just take them rascals out in the swamp
You put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest

And you know what's wrong with the world today?
People done gone put their Bibles away
And they're living by the law of the jungle
Not the law of the land
And the Good Book says it, so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you goin'
Remember who you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

Better watch where you go
And remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

Thank you
Thank you kindly
We're gonna do a song for you right now
